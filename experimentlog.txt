[Starship Icarous: The experiment]

The theorem is sound.
The experiments in Stellar Field manipulation were a rousing success.

Even if only for an instant.

Today, we initialize the first full scale Stellar Drive.
All eyes are watching. The entire solar system holds its breath.

We have been reaching for the stars, but we have yet to touch them.
Today that will change.

The Icarous will prove my theory once and for all.
Earning the title of Earth's first Starship.
